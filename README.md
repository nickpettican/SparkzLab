# My personal Jekyll website!

My Jekyll theme is based on the [{ Personal } theme](https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme), which is in turn a fork of [Timeline](https://github.com/kirbyt/timeline-jekyll-theme) (mashup of [Grayscale by Start Bootstrap](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-grayscale) and [Agency Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme))

You can watch it in action [here](https://www.nicolaspettican.com/)!

Screenshot will be available soon :smile:

## How to run locally

First, you need to install jekyll and the dependencies of { Personal } by running:

````
./scripts/install
````

Then, you can build and serve your website by simply running:

````
./scripts/serve-production
````

Easy pease :grin:!
